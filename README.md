# GitHub Topic Explorer

## Assignment:

Your task is to build a React web application that displays all the "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#topic)" related to the term "react", using the GitHub GraphQL API.

The application should display how many "[stargazers](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection)" each topic has. A click on a topic should display the topics related to that topic, and how many stargazers they have. And so forth. There should also be Search capability to search/query on any term or topic. You should implement best practices with the UI.

To interact with the Github GraphQL API you'll need to have
  * a [Github API key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql)
  * You'll want to make use of the key in the .env file within your application

You may use whatever React framework or library you find useful. URL routing is optional.


## Evaluation:

* We will pay particular attention to the way the code is organized, and to the overall readability
* Unit tests will be greatly appreciated
* Design will be ignored, however usability and accessibility will be taken into consideration
* Remember to update this README with instructions on how to install, run and test your application
* Your first goal is to have a working app, but feel free to improve the application however you see fit
* We hope that you can complete the assignment within 2 hours but don't set any time constraints
* Please reach out per email or by opening an issue if anything is unclear or blocking you

Best of luck

## Dev Notes

* `@apollo/client`: allows for GraphQL.
* `classnames`: allows joining of classNames together.
* `eslint`: allows standardizing code patterns for cleaner code style.
* `node-sass`: allows for use of Sass.
* `prop-types`: allows runtime type checking for React Component Props.

### How to run app & test

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm linter`

Runs eslint on code.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Future Improvements

Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics

* Code Structuring:

* Refactoring:

* Additional Features (Todos if more time):
  * Do not use create-react-app, but build own webpack from scratch.
  * Need to learn more about React Testing Suite.
